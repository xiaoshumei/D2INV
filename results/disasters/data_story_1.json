      "narration": "Drought dominates the deadliest single-year events: China’s 1931 flood (3.7 M deaths) is the only non-drought entry in the top-5; the other four are droughts—1928 China (3 M), 1920 China (2.5 M), 1943 India (1.9 M) and 1942 India (1.5 M). These five years together account for ≈16.6 M deaths, about 25 % of all 1900-2017 disaster fatalities.",

      "narration": "Before 1950 drought and epidemic spikes drove extreme annual variability (σ ≈ 643 k deaths); after 1950 variability fell but remained substantial (σ ≈ 154 k) while earthquake, flood and storm fatalities became the main contributors to remaining risk.",

      "question": "Is the global drop in drought deaths uniform or do localized high-mortality events still occur?",

      "narration": "The 2000s mark a mortality transition: total disaster deaths average 84 k yr⁻¹ versus 53 k yr⁻¹ in the 1990s, while economic losses soared, suggesting adaptation (early-warning, building codes) is saving fewer lives than exposure of assets rises, a decoupling that accelerates after 2004.",
