      "narration": "From 1970 to 1982, average Miles per Gallon increased from around 15 to over 35, with a sharp rise after 1975, driven by fuel crises and regulatory changes.",
      "question": "How did average fuel efficiency evolve over the years, and what key events influenced this trend?",

      "narration": "Japanese and European cars consistently outperformed American cars in fuel efficiency, with Japanese models averaging over 30 MPG by 1980, while American cars remained below 20 MPG on average.",
